# 🛠️ Python Development Wrappers

> **A curated collection of Python wrappers designed for rapid development and minimal boilerplate code**

Welcome to my personal toolkit of Python wrappers! Each wrapper is designed with the philosophy of "write once, use everywhere" - providing clean, intuitive interfaces for common development tasks while maintaining full compatibility with underlying libraries.

## 🎯 Philosophy

- **Minimal Setup** - Get started with 1-2 lines of code
- **Zero Configuration** - Sensible defaults that work out of the box
- **Copy-Paste Ready** - Each wrapper is self-contained and ready to use
- **Production Ready** - Battle-tested patterns with proper error handling
- **Developer Friendly** - Clear APIs that reduce cognitive load

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Browse the wrappers** - Each folder contains a complete, documented wrapper
2. **Copy what you need** - Each wrapper is self-contained
3. **Minimal dependencies** - Only essential packages required
4. **Drop and go** - Most wrappers work with zero configuration

## 🎨 Design Principles

### **Pythonic First**
Every wrapper follows Python idioms and best practices. No fighting the language.

### **Batteries Included**
Common use cases work out of the box. Advanced features available when needed.

### **Fail Fast & Clear**
Clear error messages that tell you exactly what went wrong and how to fix it.

### **Performance Aware**
Optimized for real-world usage patterns with built-in performance monitoring.

## 🔧 Usage Patterns

### **The Copy-Paste Developer**
```bash
# Clone specific wrapper
git clone --depth 1 --filter=blob:none --sparse https://github.com/tomvsndev/wrappers
cd wrappers
git sparse-checkout set utils/logging
```

### **The Dependencies Minimalist**
Each wrapper lists only essential dependencies. No bloated package trees.

### **The Configuration Avoider**
Sensible defaults mean you can start coding immediately. Configuration is optional.
